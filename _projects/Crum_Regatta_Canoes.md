      At Swarthmore College, every spring, we have the annual Crum Regatta, where students will build boats out of available materials and race down a section of the Crum Creek that runs through the schools grounds.

      I’ve been the lead designer and builder for my team’s boat since we started competing in 2023. Every year we've learned more about how to build better boats, through changing framing constructions, material choices, and race strategies. So far, we've won in 2023 in 2025.

      Here are some photos of our boats over the years, unfortunately I don't have photos of all the drawings and designs saved as most of our boats were built in 4-5 day sprint sessions.
