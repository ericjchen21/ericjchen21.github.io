      I got an old classroom projector that had been decommissioned for free from Swarthmore College's IT department, and decided that I wanted to design and build a mount that would allow it to project onto the ceiling. I wanted to use materials that were readily available in our Makerspace, and at the time all we had was 5 ply 1/2" plywood. I was afraid that screwing into the end-grain of the plywood would result in a weak joint, so I decided to do a tab and slot construction instead.
