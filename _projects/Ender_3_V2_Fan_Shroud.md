      After a couple years of use, the original fan shroud that came with my Ender 3 V2 broke, specifically, it fell off after the threads that allowed it to be mounted to x-axis carriage tore out. This happened after repeated bed-leveling errors causing the print head to be pushed into the print bed and twisted backwards, and since the mounting threads were cut directly into the plastic of the fan shroud, they failed very quickly.

      Rather than buy a replacement fan shroud, I wanted to design one myself, and also improve upon the original design. My list of requirements was as follows:

  - text: |
      1. Change the mounting system to avoid plastic threads and prevent threads tearing out
      2. Keep the same number of fans as the original design
      3. Add a second hot-end cooling duct for symmetrical cooling
      4. Make the fans easier to remove to increase serviceability 
      5. Make the cable-routing neater and easier to follow
      6. Retain the CR Touch sensor mount
      7. Add a bracket to relocate the extruder and support direct-drive extrusion
      8. Minimize the need for support material
      9. Make it look cool

      Using CAD models of all the printhead components I found online, I designed my new and improved fan shroud:

  #     In my new design, instead of mounting the fan shroud with screw threaded into the plastic, I used a keyhole mounting system that slots onto the x-axis roller wheel bolts, reducing the number of screws necessary for the printhead assembly. For the fans, I used screws threaded into
