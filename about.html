    Hi, my name is Eric Chen. I'm currently a senior at Swarthmore College
    pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Engineering with minors in Computer
    Science and Applied Mathematics, and I hope to work at the cutting edge of
    mobility technology, optimizing machines to move humanity both further and
    faster than ever before.
    <br />
    <br />
    I also like working on cars and other engineering projects, designing,
    fabricating, and coding, and learning about all the ways I can turn the
    ideas in my head into products in my hands. I also have two cats, Molly, and
    Tuna, and in my spare time I enjoy archery, climbing, and cooking.
